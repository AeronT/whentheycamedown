When They Came Downâ€”A People's History of Reclaiming our Space from Genocide, Colonialism, and Slavery

## What this is about

This is intended to be a people's history of removing the public legacies to genocide, colonialism, and slavery from public space. This is about removing statues, plaques, art, and other testaments to the shameful legacies of white supremacy and colonialism worldwide.

## What qualifies?

The removal of any publicly-visible memorial, monument, statue, or other noteworthy memento of a time when the privileged oppressed the vulnerable. This can be either through direct action, municipal action, or private action.

## How do I contribute?

Add a markdown post under `content/post`. Use previous posts as an example. For post date, try to get, as near as possible, the date and time the memorial was removed. Add photo credits, and try to provide many references, where possible.

Images go in `static/img`.
