When They Came Downâ€”A People's History of Reclaiming our Space from Genocide, Colonialism, and Slavery

## What this is about

This is intended to be a people's history of removing the public legacies to genocide, colonialism, and slavery from public space. This is about removing statues, plaques, art, and other testaments to the shameful legacies of white supremacy and colonialism worldwide.

## What qualifies?

The removal of any publicly-visible memorial, monument, statue, or other noteworthy memento of a time when the privileged oppressed the vulnerable. This can be either through direct action, municipal action, or private action.

## How do I contribute?

### What do I contribute?

Contributions of all sorts are needed: edits, new content, or even just comments noting when/where something happened. Please see the next two items for more details.

### I am not confident with Github and writing markdown

At the top of this page, click "Issues". There, click the button that says "New Issue".

In the textbox that appears, go ahead and enter your content, paste any links, whatever. I'll convert it into the required format to publish.

### I am confident with Github and writing markdown

Add a markdown post under `content/post`. Use previous posts as an example. For post date, try to get, as near as possible, the date and time the memorial was removed. Add photo credits, and try to provide many references, where possible.

Images go in `static/img`.
